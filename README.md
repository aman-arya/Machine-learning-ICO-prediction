**BACKGROUND**

Crowdfunding is the process of obtaining funds for a project or company from many individuals, generally over the Internet. Typically, crowdfunding involves three actors: the fundraising team that presents the concept or project to be funded, individuals or groups who support the idea, and a moderating organisation, such as a listing website, that brings those parties together to launch the idea.

Typically, crowdfunding campaigns raise funds in exchange for monetary compensation. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, initial coin offerings (ICOs) are a novel method for companies to raise funding. In an ICO, a company raise funding from online investors by issuing and selling 'digital coins', a digital medium of value based on blockchain technology. These coins, which are frequently referred to as "cryptocurrencies," can be traded amongst investors, but they may also have some utility when utilised in the product or service offered (e.g., in their digital apps) by the fundraising team / company.

The majority of ICOs follow an 'all-or-nothing' approach in which the fundraising team or company sets a fundraising goal (such as $2 million in 60 days). If they raise sufficient funds to achieve their objective, the ICO will be deemed a success. Otherwise, their fundraising efforts will be fruitless, and they will receive nothing. On the online campaign pages, they introduce their projects and teams in detail. Figure 1 shows a sample ICO fundraising page.

An example of an ICO fundraising page is shown below:

The dataset is provided with attributes about the ICO projects from different fundraising teams / companies. The task is to predict whether a team/company will reach its fundraising goal successfully through the ICO, using various machine learning models. 

The following variables could be used as potential predictors:
